Project to model the trading of energy to different markets using various power plant models


 
Main file for modeling of the different markets.

The first sets of models consider a district with different
power sources and four different markets to sell excess energy.

For analysis, scenarios with different market prices (inflated) are
build to study the functionality of the model

The second set of models considers only one type of power plant with four 
different markets and analyzes which is the best option for selling energy,
considering only operational costs.
